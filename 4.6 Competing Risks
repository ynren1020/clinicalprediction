Prediction of outcomes other than overall mortality is often of interest and may be more complex than a standard survival analysis situation. For example, when we predict
impairment after treatment of leprosy, some patients might die before the impairment is noted. Death precludes the observation of the event of interest; it is a competing 
risk to the event of interest (impairment). Similarly, we may be interested in various different events after replacement of heart valves, such as mechanical fracture, but 
also infection (endocarditis) and thrombotic events; if these lead to explantation of the valve, these events are competing with each other, similar to the risk of death of 
other causes [446]. 

4.6.1 Actuarial and Actual Risks
We may focus on the event of interest in a "cause-specific analysis". The effect of a predictor is then analyzed with traditonal Kaplan-Meier analysis or Cox regression analysis
while simply censoring all other events. This has been labeled as "actuarial risk" analysis [212, 213]. It assumes a world where the competing risks are absent. This perspective
may be of interest when we aim for a causal interpretation of the effect of predictors on the event of interest [309]. For example, when we aim to reduce a specific event by a 
specific treatment, the relative effect may well be estimated by a traditional actuarial analysis.

For prediction of absolute risks, especially long-term risks, or risks in the elderly, it is not appropriate to ignore the competing risks [309]. Definitions of "actual risk" 
acknowlege that competing risks may preclude the observation of the event of interest. Actual risk can be described by the cumulative incidence function (CIF), which can be 
estimated in different ways [445].

4.6.4 Multistate Modeling
Rather than using cause-specific Cox regression models or a Fine & Gray model, we may also consider the use of a simple multistate model to estimate predictor effects and make 
absolute risk predictions [445]. Multistate models are considered useful when several events are of interest. Transition probabilities are specified between states, e.g., from 
healthy to CHD, from healthy to death, and from CHD to death, with model estimation methods common to survival modeling, such as cause-specific Cox models [126]. Multistate models
are very flexible and can also be used to make dynamic predictions.
