Regression models are available for several types of outcome that we may want to predict from a start point ("t = 0"), such as continuous outcomes, binary, unordered categorical,
ordered categorical, survival, and competing outcomes. The corresponding default regression models are the linear, logistic, polytomous, proportional odds, Cox, and Fine & Gray
regression models, respectively. ....

Special types of data can be encountered that require specific types of analyses. Correlated outcome data may occur by the design of a study, for example, by clustering within 
patients, or per hospital. Dynamic predictions pose more complex challenges, where multistate, landmarking, and joint models may be useful. Both the specification of such models
and the evaluation of performance are more complex than considering prediction from a baseline start point t = 0.
