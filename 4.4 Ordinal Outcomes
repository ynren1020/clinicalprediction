4.4.1 Proportional Odds Logistic regression
A straightforward extension of the logistic model is the proportional odds logistic model [371]. 
Here, a common set of regression coefficients is assumed all levels of the outcome and intercepts are estimated for each level.
The common set of beta coefficients can be thought of as a pooled estimate over the three separate sets of beta coefficients estimated at each possible dichotomization.

An advantage of the proportional odds model is its parsimony in dealing with an ordered outcome. The price we pay is the assumption of proportionality of the odds. This 
assumption is equivalent to saying that any cut-point on the outcome scale would lead to the same logistic regression coefficient. 
The model further has very similar assumptions as of the usual logistic model. 
We can graphically check the proportionality assumption in univariate analyses for each predictor. Distances between points should be identical on the logit scale for each
category of a predictor. 
The assumption of proportional odds can formally be assessed with a score test.
