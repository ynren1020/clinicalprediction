Prognostic studies are ideally designed as prospective cohort studies, where the selection of patients and definition of predictors is prespecified. Data from 
randomized clinical trials may often be useful, although representativeness of the included patients for the target population should be considered as a limitation. 
Data may also be used from retrospective designs, registries, and case-control studies, each with their strengths and limitations. 

Diagnostic studies are usually cross-sectional in design and should prospectively select all patients who are suspected of a disease of interest. In practice, designs are 
still frequent where patients are selected based on a reference test which is not performed in all patients.

Predictors may be defined pragmatically and cover the relevant areas in a disease. The outcome of a prediction model should be measured with high accuracy. Hard end points such 
as mortality are often preferred. 

With any study design, we should aim for large sample size for reliable testing and estimation of predictor effects, reliable model building, and reliable assessment of 
model performance. At least 100 events may be required for any model development or validation, and more for detailed modeling and addressing more refined research questions.
A development sample with 100 events corresponds to EPS = 10 with 10 candidate predictors. More than 100 events are needed if more than 10 candidate predictors are considered.
Higher sample size are desired for multi-setting validation, with data from many different settings if claims about generalizability are made.
