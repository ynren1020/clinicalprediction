The focus in this book is on making predictions from a defined start point where baseline predictors are measured. Dynamic predictions may, however, also be of interest.
For example in survival after a cancer diagnosis, patients may be interested in their prognosis given that they survived for some time without recurrence of disease. 
Their survival estimate will then be higher than at the time of diagnosis. This pattern can well be illustrated with relative survival curves. Similarly, a bond marrow transplant
recipient may not have had graft versus host disease for some time. He/she will have a better prognosis than at the time of receiving the transplant. A simple method to analyze 
the impact of such an intermediate event is to use a time-dependent variable in a Cox regression model. More elegant models are available that are better suited for dynamic prediction [622].

4.7.1 Multistate Models and Landmarking
A multistate model is very useful if we aim to predict the flow of subsequent events, including intermediate states. It can also be used to estimate the cumulative probability for a final
state, incorporating time-dependent information, such as not being in an intermediate state for some time. Several examples are provided in a tutorial and recent textbooks [180, 445, 622].

For prediction, an interesting approach is to use the concept of "landmarking". Landmarks are fixed points in time during follow-up. We consider patients at risk at the landmark time
(removing those with earlier events or censoring before the landmark) and update the predictor information, including intermediate events that may have occured. Prediction models can be 
fitted at each landmark, but stacking of landmark data sets allows for more flexibility in modeling [625]. Fewer parameters may be needed for a landmark model than for a multistate
model, and predictions are more easily obtained [445].

4.7.2 Joint Models 
Another situation is that continuous measurements of disease activity are available during follow-up. An example is the prediction of mortality in human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)-
infected patients based on their longitudinal CD4 cell count measurements [461]. Another example is monitoring of diabetes patients by their blook sugar levels (Hb1Ac measurements).
We may be interested in predicting complications of diabetes, such as a diabetic foot, based on the dynamic HbA1c pattern [369].

The predictive role of a continuous, dynamic marker can well be modeled with a joint model, which combines a model for longitudinal data (for a repeatedly measured predictor) with time-to
-event data (for prediction of the event of interest). Dynamic survival probabilities can be estimated for future subjects based on their available longitudinal measurements and 
a fitted joint model [462].

Technically, we need to define an appropriate model to describe the evolution of the marker in time for each patient. This is typically done using a mixed model, which at least allows
for subject-specific baseline levels of the marker. Next, the estimated evolutions of the marker are used in a Cox regression model to predict the event of interest. The marker
level is not assumed constant in time but follows a dynamic pattern. The hazard for the event of interest can be related to the current marker value but also the change in time
(slope of the trajectory) or the area under the curve [369].

Joint models are of interest for personalized predictions since they utilize random effects and therefore have an inherent subject-specific nature. This may allow to better
tailor decisions to individual patients, i.e., personalize screening, rather than using the same screening rule for all [462, 585].
