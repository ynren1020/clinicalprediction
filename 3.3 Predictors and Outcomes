# 3.3.1 Strength of Predictors
For a well-performing prediction model, strong predictors have to be present.

Strength is a function of the association of the predictor with the outcome ("effect size"), and the distribution of the predictor.
For example, a dichotomous predictor with an odds ratio of 2.0 is more relevant for a prediction model than a dichotomous predictor 
with an odds ratio of 2.5, when the first predictor is distributed in a 50:50 ratio (50% prevalence of the predictor), and the second
1:99 (1% prevalence of the predictor). 
Similarly, continuous predictors have to cover a wide range to make them relevant for prediction.

When some characteristics are considered as key predictors, these have to be registered carefully, with clear definitions and preferably 
no missing values. This is usually best possible in a prospective study, with a protocol and prespecified data collection form.

# 3.3.2 Categories of Predictors 
Several categories of predictors have been suggested for prediction models [225].
These include 
- demographics (e.g., age, sex, race, education, socioeconomic status, ? BMI)
- type and severity of disease (e.g., principal diagnosis, presenting characteristics)
- history characteristics (e.g., previous disease episodes, risk factors)
- comorbidity (concomitant diseases)
- physical functional status (e.g., Karnofsky score, WHO performance score), and 
- subjective health status and quality of life (psychological, cognitive, psychosocial functioning).

# 3.3.3 Costs of Predictors 
Predictors may require different costs, in monetary terms, but also in burden for a patient. In a prediction context, it is evident that 
information that is easy to obtain should be considered before information that is more difficult to obtain. Hence, we should first consider
characteristics such as demographics and patient history, followed by simple diagnostic tests, and finally invasive and/or costly tests.

# 3.3.4 Determinants of Prognosis 
Prognosis can also be viewed in a triangle of interacting causes. Predictors may be separated as related to environment (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, 
health care access and quality, climate), the host (e.g., demographic, behavioral, psychosocial, premorbid biologic factors), and disease (e.g., imaging, 
pathophysiologic, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic factors)[237].

# 3.3.5 Prognosis in Oncology 
For prognosis in oncology, it has been proposed to separate factors related to the patient, the tumor and to treatment [239]. Examples of patients characteristics
include demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, SES), comorbidity, and functional status. Tumor characteristics include the extent of disease (e.g., reflected in TNM stage), 
pathology, and sometimes values of tumor markers. Treatment may commonly include (combinations of) surgery, chemotheray, and radiotherapy.
