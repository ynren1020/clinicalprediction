15.1 Overall Performance Measures
The distance between the predicted outcome ^y and actual outcome y is a central to quantify overall model performance from a statistical perspective [231].
The distance, or residual is y - ^y for continuous outcomes. For binary outcomes, ^y is equal to the predicted probability p, and for survival outcomes, it is the predicted time to an event.
These distance between observed and predicted outcomes are related to the concept of "goodness-of-fit" of a model, and the amount of variability that is explained.
Better models have smaller distances between predicted and observed outcomes (y - ^y).
