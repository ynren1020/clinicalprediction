Categorical outcomes without a clear ordering are common in diagnostic medical problems. The diagnostic process starts with considering presenting signs and symptoms of a patient.
This leads the physician toward a set of differential diagnoses. Each diagnosis has a probability given the patient's clinical and nonclinical profile. Usually, one of these 
differential diagnoses is defined as the working diagnosis or target disease, to which the diagnostic workup is primarily directed. Consequently, diagnostic studies commonly focus 
on the ability of tests to include or exclude the presence of this target disease. The alternative diagnoses (which may direct different treatment decisions) are thus included in 
the outcome category "target disease absent". After dichotomization of the diagnostic outcome, we may develop diagnostic prediction rules with logistic regression analysis. This focus
on the target disease is a simplification of clinical practice.

4.3.1 Polytomous logistic regression
Several studies discussed the use of polytomous (or multinomial) logistic regression to accommodate simultaneous prediction of three or more unordered outcome categories [44, 605, 671].
The model for j outcome categories can be written as 
                    logodds(y = j versus y = reference) = alphaj + betai,j*xi = lpj
where j-1 models are fitted each with separate sets of intercept alpha and regression coefficients betai. We illustrate the polytomous model for prediction of three diagnostic outcome
categories in a detailed case study.

4.3.2 Example: Histology of Residual Masses
Polytomous logistic regression analysis requires that one of the outcome categories is chosen as the reference category. For the other outcome categories, the polytomous logistic 
regression analysis fits submodels that compare the outcome categories with the chosen reference. Thus, for each outcome category, different regression coefficients are estimated 
for each predictor. These submodels together comprise the polytomous model and can be used to estimate the probability of the presence of each diagnostic outcome.

                    Logit(benign vs. cancer) = alphab + beta1,b*x1 + ... + betap,b*xp = betai,bX = lpb;
                    Logit(teratoma vs. cancer) = alphat + beta1,t*x1 + ... + betap,t*xp = betai,tX = lpt;

The subscript b indicates that we predict the odds of benign tissue, and subscript t for teratoma with p predictors.

The interpretation of the regression coefficients is similar as for dichotomous logistic regression, i.e., the log odds of the outcome (benign tissue or mature teratoma) relative to
cancer per unit change in the predictor values. The probabilities of benign and teratoma tissue can be calculated by
               P(benign tissue) = exp(lpb)/(1+exp(lpb)+exp(lpt))
               P(mature teratoma) = exp(lpt)/(1+exp(lpb)+exp(lpt))

As probabilities need to sum to 1, the probability of cancer can then be calculated by 
                P(cancer) = 1 - P(benign tissue) - P(mature teratoma)
