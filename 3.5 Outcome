# 3.5.1 Types of Outcomes

Prognostic outcome 
- fatal events (all-cause, or cause-specific. Hard end point, relevant in many diseases, but sometimes too infrequent for reliable statistical modeling)
- nonfatal events (recurrence of tumor, cardiovascular events, e.g., myocardial infarction, revascularization. Somewhat softer end point, reflecting decision-making by physicians,
  increases sample size for analysis)
- patient-centered (Symptoms, functional status, health-related quality of life, utilities. Subjective end point, focused on the patients themselves, often used as secondary end point)
- Wider burden (Absence from work because of sickness. Especially of interest from an economical point of view)

# 3.5.4 Composite End Points
Sometimes, composite end points are defined, which combine mortality with nonfatal events. Composite end points are especially popular in cardiovascular research. 
For example, the Framingham models have been used to predict incident cardiovascular disease in the general population. A popular Framingham model (the Wilson model)
defines cardiovascular events as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, sudden death, or angina pectoris (stable or unstable).

Composite end points have the advantage of increasing the effective sample size, and hence the power for statistical analyses, at the price of having to assume similar prognostic 
associations for each of the end point components.

# 3.5.5 Example: Composite End Points in Cardiology 
A prediction model was developed in 949 patients with decompensated heart failure. The outcomes were 60-day mortality and the composite end point of death or rehospitalization 
at 60 days. The discriminatory power of the model was substantial for the mortality model (c statistic 0.77) but less for the composite end point (c statistic 0.69). These findings
are in line with prediction of acute coronary syndromes, where predictive performance was better for mortality than for a composite end point of mortality or myocardial (re)infarction.

# 3.5.6 Choice of Prognostic Outcome
The choice of a prognostic outcome should be guided by the context, but the outcome should be measured as reliably as possible. Prediction models may be developed with pragmatic 
definitions of predictors, since this may resemble the future use of a model. But the outcome should be determined with similar rigor as in an etiologic study or randomized 
clinical trial. Predictions, hence, need to be based on robust statistical associations with an accurately determined outcome.

If there is a choice between binary and continuous outcomes, the latter are preferred from a statistical perspective, since they provide more power in the statistical analysis.
Also, ordered outcomes have more power than binary outcomes. In practice, binary outcomes are however very popular, making logistic regression and Cox regression the most common 
prediction models in medicine [653].
