Survival, or time-to-event, analysis is appropriate for outcomes that occur during follow-up. The most straightforward outcome is to consider death from any cause. 
A key characteristic of such survival data is that the follow-up of patients is typically incomplete. For example, some patients may have been followed for 1 year, 
others for 3 years, etc., while we may be interested in estimates of 5-year survival. Patients with such incomplete data are called censored observations. 
Because of censoring, logistic regression for the outcome (as a binary variable) is inappropriate. One should think of linear regression on the survival time (a continuous
outcome), but again censoring makes such an analysis usually inappropriate.

4.5.1 Cox Proportional Hazards Regression
In medical and epidemiological studies, the Cox proportional hazard model is most often used for survival outcomes [113]. It is the natural extension of the logistic model to the 
survival setting. Indeed, the Cox model is equivalent to conditional logistic regression, with conditioning at times where events occur [325]. In the logistic model, we use an 
intercept in the linear predictor, while in the Cox model a baseline hazard function is used. So, baseline risk in the logistic model is given by an intercept, and in the Cox model
by the baseline hazard function, which can be seen as a time-dependent intercept. The hazard function indicates the risk of the event of interest during follow-up. It is 
nonparametric in the Cox model. As for the logistic model, simpler and more extensive methods exist, which can be seen as special cases or extensions of the Cox model [579]. 
The Cox regression model is often stated as a function of the hazard function [653]:
                lamda(t|X) = lamda(t)exp(beta*X),
where lamda(t) is the hazard at time t, and beta*X is the linear predictor, beta1*x1 + beta2*x2 + beta3*x3 + ... + betap*xp.

The linear predictor is usually centered at the mean values of the predictors, and exp(beta*X) then indicates the hazard ratio compared to the average risk profile. Note that the 
linear predictor relates to the log of the hazard: 
                log(lamda(t|X)) = log(lamda(t)) + beta1*x1 + beta2*x2 + ... + betap*xp

The Cox regression model is semi-parametric. It makes a parametric assumption on the effect of predictors, i.e., proportionality of effect during follow-up. The hazard function lamda(t)
is nonparametric. This is commonly considered an advantage of the model when we focus on the effect of predictors. Regression coefficients betai can readily be estimated by the partial
likelihood, and shrinkage or penalization can be done. The quantity exp(beta) is the hazard ratio, similar to how we calculate the odds ratio from a logistic regression coefficient.

4.5.6 Parametric Survival
Whereas Kaplan-Meier analysis represents a more nonparametric approach, parametric survival models are less flexible than Cox regression in their dealing with the baseline hazard 
function. Parametric models typically assume proportionality of the predictor effects, but a more smoothed baseline hazard over time. Examples of parametric models include the 
exponential model (or Poisson model, using a constant hazard), and the Weibull model (two parameters to let the hazard increase or decrease monotonically over time). The exponential
and Weibull model can also be seen as examples of accelerated failure time (AFT) models. Here, the effects of predictors are not viewed as multiplicative on the hazards scale, but 
as multiplicative on the time axis (or additive at the log-time axis). Other examples of AFT models are the lognormal and log-logistic model [225, 653].

Regression coefficients in exponential or Weibull models are hazard ratios after exponentiating. In AFT models, they represent a change in the log-time. The advantage of parametric
survival models is their concise, parsimonious formulation, and smoothing of the underlying hazard. This makes these models especially attractive for prediction purposes. Extrapolation
is readily possible with parametric models, but not with Cox or Kaplan-Meier analysis because of their nonparametric nature. Predictions at the end of the follow-up are unstable
with Cox or Kaplan-Meier analysis, and more robust with parametric methods; at the price of making the assumption that the baseline hazard is modeled well. 
For estimation of the effect of predictors, the Cox model may often be more suitable, since this model is less restrictive than an exponential or Weibull model. ...

4.5.8 Summary of Survival Outcomes 
In sum, the Cox regression model provides a default framework for prediction of long-term prognostic outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis provides a nonparametric method but requires
categorization of all predictors. It is the equivalent of cross-tables for binary or categorical outcomes in a survial context. Parametric survival models may be useful for predictive
purposes because of their parsimony and robustness, for example, at the end of follow-up, or even beyond the observed follow-up. In survival analysis, repeated events may occur, 
that are correlated because of underlying frailty in individual patients. This asks for extensions of the Cox model when modeling repeated events within the same patients [517, 579].
